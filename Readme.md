# How to add a constant line to an axis


<p>This example demonstrates how a <a href="http://devexpress.com/Help/Content.aspx?help=XtraCharts&document=CustomDocument5783.htm">constant line</a> can be created and customized at runtime.</p><p>Since constant lines belong to a diagram's <a href="http://devexpress.com/Help/Content.aspx?help=XtraCharts&document=CustomDocument6016.htm">axis</a>, first it's required to cast your <a href="http://devexpress.com/Help/Content.aspx?help=XtraCharts&document=CustomDocument6017.htm">diagram</a> object to the appropriate diagram's type. After that, it's possible to access axes and manage their constant lines collection.</p>
